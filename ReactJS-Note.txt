ReactJS
	- JavaScript library to build user interfaces.
	- Surprisingle, we can make components and use them dynamically for whatever we want to make.

	- we can break down a very complex structure into a component tree.
	- Example (all of these are components):
		- App
			- NavBar
			- ToDoList
				- ListItem
					- CheckBox
					- ItemText

	- <MyHeader/>
	- <PageContent/>
	- <MyFooter/>

	- each component has its own ( html, css and js ) files in the small chunks, we can have it as many as we want it to be.
	- each time it refreshes the component, whenever it updates.

ReactDOM.render
	- What to show and where to show it.
	- all of this happens with the help of JSX.

JSX
	- it is the core component of react
	- JSx stands for JavaScript XML, that allow us the write the HTML code in react.
		- React will internally convert this into a virtual DOM, and will ultimately output out HTML for us.

	- ReactJs is a JS front-end Library, that uses the Virtual DOM.
	- React application is made up of multiple components, each for outputting small, reusable piece of HTML

Babel
	- is a JS compiler, that converts it into the browser compatible JS
